# Understanding Docker Concepts

Docker, an open-source project launched in 2013, has helped popularize technology and has helped drive the trend towards containerization and micro services in software development that's known as cloud-native development.

# What is Virtualization?

Virtualization is the technique of importing a Guest operating system on top of a Host operating system. This technique was a revelation at the beginning because it allowed developes to run many operating system in different virtual machines, all running on the same host. These eliminated the need for extra hardware resources.

# What is Containerization

Containerization is a form of operating system virtualization, through which it runs applications in secluded user spaces called containers, all using the same shared operating systems (OS).

# What is Docker
Docker is a tool designed to make it easier to create, deploy, and run application by using containers. Containers allow a developer to package up an application with all of the parts it needs, such as libraries and other dependencies, and deploy it as one package. Initially, built for Linux, Docker now runs on Windows and macOS. To understand how Docker works, let's look at some components you would use to create Docker-containerized applications.

# Docker Terms and Tool
Some of the tools and terminology you'll encounter when using Docker include the following:
